/*
in any java code, there should be at least one function which is the main function.
This function doesn't exist on it's own but belongs to a class
Class is a container for related functions 
And the main class is called main and the function that we describe in it belongs to the class and is called a "Method"
a "method" is a function that is part of a  class or belongs to it but when a function that doesn't belong to a class it is called a "function"

all these classes and methods should have an access modifier and this determines if other classes and methods can access these classes and methods like : Public, Private and so on.
why the name of the class is capital because we use the PascalNamingConvention and with methods we use camelNamingConvention
